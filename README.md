# LongestSequenceOfOne

I did the solution in C#.

To open the source code just open the .sln file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
There are two projects, one with the console app that will run the app and other is a test project for the functionality.
Build the console application test in Release mode.

To run in command line go to path ConsoleApp1\bin\Release and run the exe file named ConsoleApp1.exe with two arguments.

example : Open Command Line
	  cd ConsoleApp1\bin\Release
	  ConsoleApp1.exe Longest 1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
